YORI - Web POC (V1 Mockup)
"Ton refuge créatif et apaisant"

This repository contains a comprehensive web-based Proof of Concept (POC) for YORI, a mobile journaling application designed for Gen Z. It serves as an interactive mockup to demonstrate the core value proposition, user flow, and aesthetic "vibe" of the V1 product before full mobile development.

🌸 About The Project
YORI is a Zen-Gacha Journaling App. It combines the therapeutic benefits of journaling with the fun of collecting digital stationery (stickers, papers, washi tapes) created by human artists.

Key Features Demonstrated in this POC:

The Daily Ritual: Opening a digital "envelope" to receive daily rewards (gacha mechanic without monetization pressure).

Digital Scrapbooking: A tactile editor to write thoughts and decorate pages with stickers.

Wellness Tracking: A "Pixel Year" mood tracker and emotional insights.

Collection System: A "Pokedex" style gallery for collected assets.

Ethical Stance: Simulates an ecosystem based on 100% human art (No AI).

📱 Scope of this POC
What this is:

A high-fidelity interactive mockup built with HTML/CSS/JS.

A demonstration of the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) flows.

A visual representation of the app's "Cozy" & "Aesthetic" design language.

Functional enough to simulate the core loop (Onboarding -> Home -> Envelope Reveal -> Journaling -> Collection).

What this is NOT:

A fully functional backend-connected app (Data is stored in localStorage).

A production-ready mobile codebase (It's a web app simulating a mobile view).

The final product (Features are simulated for demonstration purposes).

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 / CSS3: Custom styling with CSS Variables for easy theming (Cream, Terracotta, Ink palette).

Vanilla JavaScript: Logic for navigation, state management (using localStorage), and simulated interactivity (drag & drop, modal management).

Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile-first viewing (best experienced on a phone or in a mobile-sized browser window).


📂 Project Structure
index.html: Contains the entire POC logic (Single Page Application structure).

CSS Section: Defines the design system (Variables, Typography, Components).

HTML Structure: Screens are divided into sections (Onboarding, Home, Editor, etc.) shown/hidden via JS.

JS Logic: Handles user state, navigation, sticker inventory, and "fake" logic (like the daily envelope timer).

✨ Key User Flows to Test
Onboarding: Complete the wellness questionnaire to personalize the experience.

The Reveal: Tap the envelope on the Home screen to trigger the animation and unlock new stickers.

Journaling: Go to "Écrire", type a note, and try the formatting tools. Open the palette to see your new stickers.

Collection: Visit the "Collection" tab to see your unlocked assets sorted by rarity.

Pixel Year: Check the "Humeur" quick action to log a mood and see it on the calendar.

This is a closed POC for internal demonstration and investor pitching. However, feedback on the UX flow is welcome!
